Situation: The lower torso curve is integral to determining how pants fit on the body. The crotch curve in pants patterns is often drawn carelessly, leading to fit issues.

Action: We employed techniques such as logistic regression, tree-based models, clustering, and dimension reduction to create a blueprint for fitting and grouping crotch curves across different races.

Result: Unfortunately, the clustering approach did not provide evidence that the features are strong predictors of race. However, we achieved an accuracy of 0.86 in predicting the race of each individual.
