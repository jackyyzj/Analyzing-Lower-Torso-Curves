Situation: The lower torso curve is integral to determining how pants fit on the body. The crotch curve in pants patterns is often drawn carelessly, leading to fit issues.

Actions:
1. Preprocessed a large Airbnb dataset such as remove not informative data and filling missing values using different methods to ensure data integrity and consistency;
2. Performed feature engineering such as one hot encoding for categorical data and selection to create informative variables for modeling;
3. Used Heat map, Word cloud, bar plot, box plot, correlation matrix to perform data visualization;
4. Predicted rental price for machine learning by Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost;
5. Evaluated model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics and validated on a holdout dataset;
7. Provided actionable insights and recommendations to stakeholders, including pricing strategies and property improvements based on the model results.

We employed techniques such as logistic regression, tree-based models, clustering, and dimension reduction to create a blueprint for fitting and grouping crotch curves across different races.

Result: Unfortunately, the clustering approach did not provide evidence that the features are strong predictors of race. However, we achieved an accuracy of 0.86 in predicting the race of each individual.
