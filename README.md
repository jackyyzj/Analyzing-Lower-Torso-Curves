Situation: The lower torso curve is integral to determining how pants fit on the body: the crotch curve in pants patterns is often drawn carelessly, leading to issues with fit. 

Action: We employ techniques such as logistic regression, tree-based models, clustering, and dimension reduction to create a blueprint for fitting and grouping crotch curves across different races. 

Result: Unfortunately, the clustering approach did not provide evidence that the features are strong predictors of race. However, we achieved 0.86 accuracy on the race prediction of each individual.
